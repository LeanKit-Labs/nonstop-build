## 0.1.0

### prerelease 7
 * Improve how build files get searched for. Consult you a [Doug Neiner](https://github.com/dcneiner) for great good! 
 * Add ability to persist build data as JSON or YAML formatted file.

### prerelease 6
Add missing dependency to the package.json file.

### prerelease 5
Add a nopack feature to allow building without creating a package. Added for the CLI to make it easy to test a build's validity w/o having to overwrite the package each time you test.

### prerelease 4
NPM wouldn't allow -3 to be published :rage1: (even a force failed). Bumped the version.

### prerelease 3
Support a call to check for the existence of a valid build file in the repository.

### prerelease 2
Support building a single project by name.
